# Playground for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK

## Getting Started

The [SDK documentation](https://aka.ms/csspeech) has extensive sections about getting started, setting up the SDK, as well as the process to acquire the required subscription keys. You will need subscription keys to run the samples on your machines, you therefore should follow the instructions on these pages before continuing.
